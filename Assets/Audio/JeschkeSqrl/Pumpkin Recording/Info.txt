This is a bunch of sounds cropped from a recording I did of squishing around the insides of a pumpkin for an hour or so. o: Should be good to add some fleshy goopiness and squelching to whatever you've got going on!

Misc. = miscellanious
Passives = General squelchiness without getting too energetic
Splats or hits = Sharper hits with little squish attached
Squelches = Firm squishes with varying amounts of squish around them. Harder squishing!

All were recorded with a r0de NT5 going through a focusrite octopre.

This pack was recorded and made by Jeschke! All sounds within are free to use for your vorish animations, games, or what-have-you, whether you use them as-is or edit them. If you use some of the sounds in your projects, attribution would be nice, but it isn't necessary. If you want to officially license these for a large commercial product, like a video game or movie, or such, then I'd love to discuss licensing and payment and such. (But since I'll be distributing these on FA and Eka's Portal and since I'm not a professional foley recorder, I kind of doubt that will happen.)
