Various slurping noises!

The ones in the Eblis recording folder are ones I recorded for the POV file The Neighbor, which got me to give recording slurping a try, at which point I realized it works really pretty well! And the ones in the "Cup with and without straw" were done with, you guessed it, a cup and/or a straw. Some of them are kind of overly direct and may not be as useful, but, as always, I included everything I've recorded in the spirit of sharing a complete audio library.

This pack was recorded and made by Jeschke! All sounds within are free to use for your vorish animations, games, or what-have-you, whether you use them as-is or edit them. If you use some of the sounds in your projects, attribution would be nice, but it isn't necessary. If you want to officially license these for a large commercial product, like a video game or movie, or such, then I'd love to discuss licensing and payment and such. (But since I'll be distributing these on FA and Eka's Portal and since I'm not a professional foley recorder, I kind of doubt that will happen.)
